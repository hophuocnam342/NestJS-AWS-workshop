We will use the following 2 services for monitoring:

**AWS CloudTrail** is an Amazon Web Services (AWS) service that records the activity of your AWS account, including actions performed by users, roles, or AWS services. It acts as an auditing and monitoring tool, recording events in logs, allowing users to review activity history, analyze risks, and ensure compliance with regulations.

->**CloudTrail**: Tracks every action (API call, resource creation/deletion, etc.) on an AWS account.

**Amazon CloudWatch** is a monitoring and management service that provides actionable data and insights for AWS infrastructure resources and applications, hybrid applications, and on-premises applications. You can collect and access all performance and operational data in the form of logs and metrics in one platform, instead of monitoring them individually (servers, networks, or databases). CloudWatch allows you to monitor end-to-end (applications, infrastructure, and services) and leverage alarms, logs, and event data to automate actions and reduce Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR). This service helps you free up critical resources to focus on building applications and business value.

-> **CloudWatch**: Log monitoring, metrics, and alarms for EC2/backend.
