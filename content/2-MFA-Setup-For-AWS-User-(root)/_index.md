To deploy the backend effectively on AWS, we use **Amazon EC2** which is one of the cores of AWS. The great features it brings:
- **Amazon EC2** works similar to traditional virtual servers or physical servers, but with the ability to initialize quickly, scale resources flexibly and manage simply.
- **Virtual servers** divide physical servers into many virtual servers, helping to optimize the use of hardware resources.

**Amazon EC2** supports a variety of workloads such as: web hosting, applications, databases, authentication services and any task that a regular server can perform.
